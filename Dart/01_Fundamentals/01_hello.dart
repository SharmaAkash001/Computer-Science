// Variables
// In dart we just need to use 'var' for declaring the variables
var name = "Akash";
var sem = 3;
var float = 3.6;

// In languages like Dart, variables don't directly contain the values; 
// instead, they hold references to objects in memory. When you assign a value to a variable, 
// you are actually assigning a reference to the memory location where the value (object) is stored.
